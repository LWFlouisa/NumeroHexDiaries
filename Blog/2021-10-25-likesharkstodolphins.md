It was months sense<br />
I met the girl from my past.<br />
The sea so avast.<br />

At the beach hut<br />
I wait till nightfall to<br />
unleash blood.<br />

I like blood<br />
to much, it livens<br />
me in my sleep.<br />

Earlier I<br />
swam along the waves,<br />
like the sharks to<br />

the dolphins under<br />
the sea.
